## Overview
This Trello Clone backend manages:
- **Boards**: logical containers for projects or workflows.
- **Lists**: categories or stages within each board.
- **Cards**: tasks or items placed in lists, which can be created, updated, or deleted.

Users can integrate this backend with any frontend of choice (e.g., a web or mobile client) by making requests to the appropriate endpoints.

---

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete boards, lists, and cards.
- **MongoDB Integration**: Store and retrieve board data from a MongoDB instance.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easily extend functionality (e.g., user authentication) without rewriting core logic.
- **No UI Included**: Designed for use with external clients, such as Postman or custom frontends.
