## Overview
This Trello Clone allows users to create multiple boards, add lists within each board, and populate them with task cards. Thanks to **React** for the frontend and **Firebase** for backend services, the application updates in real time without additional server-side code.

---

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login/signup using Firebase Authentication.
- **Boards & Lists**: Create and manage boards containing multiple lists.
- **Cards**: Add, edit, and remove task cards under each list.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Reorder lists and cards intuitively.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Firebase Firestore ensures immediate synchronization across sessions.
- **Responsive Design**: Works smoothly on various screen sizes.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**  
  - React (Create React App)  
  - React Router DOM (for routing)  
  - React Icons (for icons)

- **Backend (Serverless)**  
  - Firebase Authentication (secure user auth)  
  - Firebase Firestore (cloud database)  
  - Firebase Storage (file/image storage, if applicable)
